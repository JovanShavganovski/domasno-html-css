                Escape from Tarkov is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game in development by Battlestate Games for Windows. A closed alpha test of the game was first made available to select users on 4 August 2016,[1] followed by a closed beta which has been running since July 2017.[2]

                The game is set in the fictional Norvinsk region, where a war is taking place between two private military companies (United Security "USEC" and the Battle Encounter Assault Regiment "BEAR"). Players join matches called "raids" in which they fight other players for loot and aim to survive and escape; dying results in the loss of all items the player used and found during that raid with few exceptions.
